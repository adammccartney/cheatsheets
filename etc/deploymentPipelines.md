https://medium.com/@vitalypanukhin/docker-compose-and-gitlab-b209d09210f6


## Goals:

+ set up basic test that the hateos container is running and receiving requests
+ if test is successful, create image 

## Questions:

+ What are those little json files used to co-ordinate gilab pipelines?
+ Are gitlab pipelines single-threaded?
