Taken from kubernetes in action
1. You have to connect to the service's clusterIP from inside the cluster
2. Don't bother pinging the service's cluster IP - it's virtual
3. Make sure the readiness probe is succeeding (otherwise pod won't be part of service)
4. Confirm that a pod is part of the service with `kubectl get endpoints`
5. If you're trying to access the pod via FQDN or a part of it, try the IP instead
6. Double check that you are connecting to the exposed port and not target port
7. Connect to the pod IP directly to confirm the pod is accepting connections
8. If you can't access your app through the pod's IP, make sure your app isn't only 
   binding to localhost.
