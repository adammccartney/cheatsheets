### copy score repo ###

List of steps to copy a score repo and set up a blank template. 

This is a document of the first attempt to do this, the basic idea is to strip
back a full working abjad repo (ins_wasser by trevor baca) to the point where
all functionality of the package is light, clear and buildable.


 1.  Clone repo from github
 2.  Copy directory tree
 3.  Remove git 
 4.  Remove personal data from repo 
 5.  Clear unused files from builds & distribution & etc folders 
 6.  Remove unused materials modules
 7.  Empty segment module 
 8.  Remove unused tools modules 
 9.  Remove unused stylesheets files 
 10. Personalize all name info in latex files
 11. Perfonalize all info in config files
 12. Remove anything else that you don't understand (travis.yml)
 13. Make repoTemplate
