# Few notes on the setup for this openframeworks project.

===============================================================================

Aim is to set up a simple graphics program using OpenFrameworks

The exercise is based on one from the pragmatic programmer book, where it is
asked in one of the early chapters to design a CLI for a turtle graphics
program.

In this variant, we're going to

generate a new project that uses the ofxArgs addon

copy over the source from of/apps/myApps/VectorGraphics101

configure so that the program can parse arguemnts from the command line at run
time. Ideally this should be a simple set up of directions that can be repeated
and used to generate complex, fractal-like graphics.
